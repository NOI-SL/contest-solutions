# King Rawanaâ€™s Palace  
&nbsp;  
Kamal is a historian looking for King Rawana's Palace. According to the ancient texts, 
there are said to be an **_N_** number of gates, each protected by a puzzle. 
Kamal has found the first entrance and is asking for your help to figure out how to solve these puzzles.

In each gate there is a grid of **_2 columns_** and **_R rows_**. 
The first row has two numbers **S1** and **S2** in the first and second column respectively. 
The numbers in all other rows is the next greater natural number to the number directly above.

On top of each gate there are **_2 numbers_**, **_D1_** & **_D2_**. 
Near the gate there are **_4 piles_** of puzzle pieces. Each puzzle piece has a word on it. 
According to the ancient text you must fill each cell with a puzzle piece based on the following rules.

   1. **If the number in the cell is divisible by D1**, it should be filled with a piece from the first pile.
   2. **If the number in the cell is divisible by D2**, it should be filled with a piece from the second pile.
   3. **If the number in the cell is divisible by both D1 & D2**, it should be filled with a piece from the third pile.
   4. **If the cell cannot be filled with a piece from the first 3 piles**, 
   it should be filled with a piece from the fourth pile.

Given the **_5 numbers_**, **_S1_**, **_S2_**, **_R_**, **_D1_** and **_D2_** 
and the words in each **_4 types_** of puzzle pieces, you must write a program to print the solution to the puzzle. 
  
## Input Format

First line contains a single integer, **_N_**.  
**_N_** lines follow, each with **_5 integers_** (**_S1_**, **_S2_**, **_R_**, **_D1_**, **_D2_** respectively), 
followed by a space and **_4 words_**, each separated by a space (words on the puzzle pieces on each pile, 
respectively).

## Constraints

- ***1 &le; N &le; 2000***
- ***1 &le; S1, S2 &le; 10<sup>8</sup>***
- ***1 &le; R &le; 100***
- ***1 &le; D1 < D2 &le; 10<sup>8</sup>***

## Output Format

For each gate print ***R*** lines - the solution for the puzzle.  
Each line should contain two space separated words.
