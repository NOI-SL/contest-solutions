# National Olympiad in Informatics Sri Lanka - Contest Solutions

Solutions & test-data for all the contests organized by National Olympiad in Informatics Sri Lanka will be hosted here. 

## Languages

Currently, NOI Sri Lanka & IOI accepts solutions written in C, C++, Java & Pascal.  
  
All the solutions by the problem setters are written in C++. 
There's no guarantee that the solutions will be written in other languages. 
But if you are willing to contribute, write the solutions and submit a PR.

## Accessing the solutions before 2023

The solutions and test data can be accessed by 2 different formats.
1. **Repository Branches**  
    You can switch to the branch of the contest.
    The branch name will be in the format of ``<year>/<<contest-name>``   
    For example the branch for 2019 screening test would be ``2019/screening-test``  
2. **Github Releases**  
    You can go to the releases page and download the zip files created for each contest.

## Accessing the solutions from 2023
1. **Repository Branches**  
    You can switch to the 2023 branch .
    In there you can find the directory relevant to each contest.  
    For example the directory  for 2023 January practice test would be ``January``  

## Compiling & Running

Following commands can be used for compiling & running each of these programs. A **C++ compiler** should be installed 
in the computer to run these solutions.

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -O2 -o <output_file_name> <source_file_name>
./<output_file_name>
```

**Example**

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -O2 -o loop1 loop1.cpp
./loop1
```

## Contribution

repository.
