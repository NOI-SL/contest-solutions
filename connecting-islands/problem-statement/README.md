# Connecting Islands  
&nbsp;  
The newly formed city X is depicted using an **M x M** grid of cells. 
The **bottom-left** corner cell of the grid is **(0,0)** while the **top-right** corner cell of the grid is 
**(M-1, M-1)**. Each cell is either **land** or **ocean**, but **not both**. 
If you are in a land cell you can walk to any one of 4 of neighboring (left, right, up or down) land cells from there. 
You can not walk into an ocean cell. Also, you canâ€™t walk outside of the grid. 

There are **N** islands in the city right now. And the islands are **rectangular shaped**. 
Therefore the island can be defined by its bottom-left cell position and upper-right cell position. In a given island, 
if bottom-left corner cell is **(x1,y1)** and upper-right corner cell is **(x2,y2)** then the total number of cells in 
that island is **(x2-x1+1) * (y2-y1+1)**. Also, any given land cell in the grid is a part of exactly one island.

The cost of converting an ocean cell to a land cell is 1. 
Write a program to find the minimum cost required to connect all lands so that you can walk from any land cell to any 
other land cell in the city.  


## Input Format

The first line of the input has **2** integers **M** and **N**, 
the size of the grid & the number of islands in the city respectively.  
Each of the next **N** lines contains **4** integers **x1<sub>i</sub>**, **y1<sub>i</sub>**, **x2<sub>i</sub>**, 
**y2<sub>i</sub>** separated by spaces, representing the **i<sup>th</sup>** island in the city.  


## Constraints

- **0 &le; x1<sub>i</sub> &le; x2<sub>i</sub> < M**
- **0 &le; y1<sub>i</sub> &le; y2<sub>i</sub> < M**

Converting cell **X** and **Z** as land cells result in connecting all land cells. 

Alternatively, we could have converted cells marked in **Y** instead of **Z**. 
But that will result in a total cost of 4 which is not optimum.
